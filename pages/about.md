Hello! My name is Rosemary Wills. I'm a physics tutor, bioinformatician, science writer, and artist. I earned my BSeD in Science Education from UGA, and currently live in Athens, GA with Oreo the dog (pictured below) and numerous houseplants. I am composed mostly of peanut m&ms and cocoa.

This site is intended as a place to share both my science-related writing and crafty projects (mostly crochet). You can find more of my work over at my main website, <a href="https://rosewills.github.io">rosewills.github.io</a>.
